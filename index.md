# Overview

&quot;The True Cost of ICT: From Materiality to Techno-Solutionism&quot; is
a workshop to be held at the [International ICT for Sustainability
(ICT4S)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ict4s-2024) conference, on Monday
the 24th of June 2024, in Stockholm, Sweden.

During the workshop, we will investigate the long term impacts of
green-tech solutions, specifically in ICT, which are avidly promoted by
technology companies and supported by governments in the Global North, as a
matter of climate injustice. We will work toward understanding the drivers
and material dependencies of these technologies, their dependence on
semiconductors and identify a research roadmap toward quantifying these
effects.

The workshop aims to be an interactive forum where we work towards joint
position statements, research outlines, or paper drafts. This collaborative
work will be fuelled by short presentations of the participants (cf. [Call
for Contributions](#call-for-contributions) below) and invited speakers but
the focus will be on discussion and collaborative work.


# Scope and Objectives

In the past few decades, the word technology has become synonymous to
digital technology or simply ‘tech’. The tech industry of today generates a
variety of gadgets, products and services that proliferates in numbers that
is beyond most of our imaginations and determines our lives in ways we do
not even realise. However, it is the semiconductor chips, one of most
important component in this digital world, that glues together everything
tech [[^1]].  The growth of semiconductor technology is unprecedented compared
to any other industrial sector, from 2000 components in a semiconductor
chip in ‘70s to 50 billion today [[^2]]. The resulting impact in our digital
life is so enormous that chips are now compared to air, both invisible and
indispensable [[^3]]. This growth is driven by a self-imposed innovation
paradigm, by the power of the ICT sector to manufacture a demand for
processing capacity that can only be satisfied by another generation of
chips, by a framework of regulations and policy that emphasises growth and
competitiveness over sufficiency [[^4]], and by an unwavering belief in
Moore’s law (i.e., semiconductor chips doubling in capacity every 2 years,
no matter what purpose they serve). This enormous ‘progress’ came with the
ubiquity and affluence of our digital lives, but also with significant
environmental problems (mostly externalised to the Global South) associated
to water, energy and material consumption, not only during production [[^5]],
but also in its usage [[^6]] and end-of-life as e-Waste related pollution [[^7]].

This unparalleled growth over the last 50 years has created for some an
apparent ‘technological utopia’ with such limitless capabilities it is
implicated in the solution to major global challenges such as the climate
crisis. In contrast, we hypothesise that the never-ending cycle of
innovation in digital/semiconductor technologies and the resulting newness
is a prime driver of techno-solutionism in our collective imagination. This
dangerous narrative, we argue, has an even bigger impact than present day
material and carbon footprint of ICT. The well-known rebound effect can
also be considered as a consequence of techno-solutionism, where continuous
drive to make power efficient ICT infrastructure ultimately results in an
increased number of devices with even larger total energy and material
consumption.

Techno-Solutionism is the deeply ingrained belief that there are
technological solutions to all problems faced by humanity, even where they
have originated form our over reliance on technology itself [[^8], [^9]]. This
is a narrative that is prevalent in the contemporary world, primarily,
though not exclusively in the Global North, and has an impact in beliefs
and critically policies that permeate our world and its governance. Mainly
through technology, it is argued, we could achieve a sustainable utopia,
full of economic growth/affluence that does not cause undue harm [[^10], [^11]].
While this is an impossible dream, in reality, this optimism actively
impedes a more decisive, meaningful and immediate action on climate (or
societal) change.  The techno-solutionist belief has become increasingly
pervasive within the general public and policy makers, particularly as a
way to counter climate change [[^12]].


## Aims and Objectives

We want to bring a group of like-minded and critical colleagues in
understanding the immediate materiality of semiconductor industry and the
techno-solutionism it exudes. We will investigate this long term impacts of
green-tech solutions avidly promoted by technology companies (and supported
by governments in the Global North) as a matter of climate
injustice [[^13], [^14]]. We aim to critically assess how the ‘progress’ in this
industry helps
to drive this optimism and increase our reliance on future green
technologies (e.g., renewable energy, electric vehicles, carbon capture,
geoengineering), while ignoring immediate consequences of climate change
and less techno-centric nature based solutions. More specifically, how the
immense investment and general utopia around the semiconductor industry,
the beating heart of all of modern technologies, is a key ingredient of our
reliance on futuristic technological solutions for climate crisis.  Within
this optimism/solutionism what gets ignored is the externalised cost and
harm of these ‘green/renewable’ technologies and the new problems they
bring when scaled up [[^13]]. We will work toward understanding the drivers
and material dependencies of these technologies, their dependence on
semiconductors and identify a research roadmap toward quantifying these
effects.

The workshop aims to be an interactive forum where we work towards joint
position statements, research outlines, or paper drafts. This collaborative
work will be fuelled by short presentations of the participants (cf. [Call
for Contributions](#call-for-contributions) below) and invited speakers but
the focus will be on discussion and collaborative work.


# Call for Contributions

the ICT industry. We ask workshop participants to submit short position
statements on topics broadly connects the list below:

1. Multi-pronged approach in understanding the global impact of
   semiconductor industry
2. Increased material and carbon impact of advanced semiconductor
   technology nodes
3. Interdisciplinary dialogue on techno- solutionism and its harm,
   particularly to Global South
4. How techno-solutionism and the growth of the semiconductor industry feed
   into each other
5. Digital and non-digital approaches and critical perspectives towards
   addressing techno- solutionism
6. The amplification of techno-solutionist ideas through (European)
   industrial policy, regulation, and research and innovation funding.

Position statements must be written in English and should not exceed one A4
page in length (excluding references). <b>Please submit your statement in PDF
format by 2024-05-24 23:59 AoE at <a

In Pakistan alone, at least half a million workers in the country work in the location-based platform economy, and rampant unemployment and inflation has meant that this number is only growing -- while working conditions are on the decline. In this talk, I will argue that while the very nature of platform work is exploitative, gig workers in the Global South find themselves in a double bind -- performing contractual work with little to no safety nets, with gross earnings that are declining as their economies worsen and currencies depreciate. I will draw from my research and reporting on the gig economy in South Asia for tech nonprofit Rest of World and extrapolate the ways in which gig workers find themselves "trapped" by algorithms that encourage them to work longer hours -- and take fewer breaks. Questions this talk will address include: How is the platform economy reinforcing colonial structures and processes? To what degree have local interventions (Bykea in Pakistan, Mana Yatri in India, PickMe in Sri Lanka) been successful in terms of disrupting existing Silicon Valley hierarchies in the Global South? |

Yet in 2022, Europe's biggest lithium mining project led by Rio Tinto in Serbia was cancelled following the spread of mass protests across the country. The local resistance thus marked a critical point of contestation of the dominant climate strategies that are fundamentally reliant on continuous extractivism. This presentation will address the expansion of extractivist projects across the globe in the name of the green transition and it will outline alternative futures that are rooted in the ideas of justice and sufficiency. |
