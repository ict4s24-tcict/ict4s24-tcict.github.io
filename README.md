# To-do List

  our workshop?

- Call for Contributions: We want this to be separate from ICT4S
  registration, I think. Do we create some form of submission site? Do we
accept all submissions or do we do some light reviewing? Do we put the
abstracts on the website prior to the workshop?
    - set up joint email address
    - ask for talk abstract
    - ask for what you want to get out of this process
    - no reviews
- send "Call for Contributions" to mailing lists and colleagues
- identify and contact invited speakers
