# To-do List

- contact PC: Will workshops be on-site or hybrid?
- extend team of organisers?
- Call for Contributions: We want this to be separate from ICT4S
  registration, I think. Do we create some form of submission site? Do we
accept all submissions or do we do some light reviewing? Do we put the
abstracts on the website prior to the workshop?
- send "Call for Contributons" to mailing lists and colleagues
- identify and contact invited speakers
